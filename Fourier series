Numerical analysis for finding Fourier series for any function :-
In this program we calculate and plot the Fourier series of any given function.
The Dirichlet conditions:
1) The function has a finite number of finite discontinuities in each period.
2) The function has a finite number of maxima and minima in each period.
3) The Integral \(\int_{0}^{T} |f(t)| \,dt\) is finite
